<div id="help">
    <p style="font-size: 12px;padding:8px;">Thank you for agreeing to
        referee for ANSEF. Your effort is greatly appreciated and is indispensable for our program
        to assist Science, Engineering, Education and the Humanities in Armenia. To date, we have
        provided more than a million dollars in grants and have supported hundreds of publications
        from Armenia in major U.S. and European journals. </p>
    <p style="font-size: 12px;padding:8px;">To review a proposal, select it
        from the list that appears on the left. You can then click the <b>View/Print button</b> to
        see the content. At the top of the proposal summary page that you would see, you can click
        on a link to download the content of the <b>proposal narrative</b>. Once you have viewed the
        proposal to your satisfaction, you can do one of several things - all functions accessible
        through buttons near the bottom of your portal: <br>(1) <b>Reject to review</b> the proposal, in
        case you feel you cannot review the proposal in question; <br>(2) <b>Save and submit review,</b>
        after you fill out scores for ALL seven rating criteria; <br>(3) <b>Save but do not submit</b>,
        which allows you to save some of your scores but leave the rest for another time to
        complete; <br>(4) <b>Send a message</b> to the administrator assigned to the proposal, for
        example for questions or further information about the proposal at hand.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 12px;padding:8px;">Each proposal needs a score in
        one of several different criteria. You can also write comments about the
        proposal: these are seen by our Research Board during the final evaluation stage and are
        <strong>not</strong> communicated to the PIs.</p>
    <p style=" color:#a00; font-size: 12px;padding:8px;"><b>All proposals
            are to be deemed confidential.</b></p>
