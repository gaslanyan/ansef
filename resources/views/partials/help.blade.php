<div id="help">
    <p style="font-size: 12px;padding:8px;">Thank you for agreeing to
        referee for ANSEF. Your effort is greatly appreciated and is indispensable for our program
        to assist Science, Engineering, Education and the Humanities in Armenia. To date, we have
        provided more than a million dollars in grants and have supported hundreds of publications
        from Armenia in major U.S. and European journals. </p>

    <p style="font-size: 12px;padding:8px;">You can view the content of the proposal by clicking the <b>View Proposal</b>
        button; You can also download a PDF version of the content by clicking <b>Download Proposal</b>. To contact
        the ANSEF Program Officer that assigned you the proposal, click <b>Contact Program Officer</b>.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 12px;padding:8px;">Once you have reviewed the
        proposal to your satisfaction, you can do one of several things - all functions accessible
        through buttons near the bottom of your portal:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Reject to review</b> the proposal, in
                case you feel you cannot review the proposal in question.</li>
            <li><b>Save and submit review</b>
                after you fill out the scores and comments. This will complete your review of the proposal
                and you will not be able to make changes to your report.</li>
            <li><b>Save but do not submit</b>,
                which allows you to save some of your scores and comments, but leave the rest of your report
                for another time to complete. You can come back at another date and continue where you left off.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: 12px;padding:8px;">ANSEF funds are limited and the competitions are very competetive.
Typically, only proposals that receive top marks in all categories qualify for grants.</p>

    <p style=" color:#a00; font-size: 12px;padding:8px;"><b>All proposals
            are to be deemed confidential and should not be shared with other people.</b></p>
